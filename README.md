# arduinoMatrixEvader

NOT OPTIMISED FOR USAGE. THIS IS JUST A UPLOAD FOR DEMONSTRATION.
I made this in school and it isn't well written or made for share.
Keep this in mind!

Arduino game where you need to evade blocks on a 8x8 Matrix

RUN MatrixMundliche.ino

**CHANGE WIFI IN MATRIXMUNDLICHE TO YOURS!!!**

You need a Esprit ESP32 DevModule with WiFi, Bluepad Bluetooth, a PS4 Controller and a SPI 8x8 Matrix

You need to start the game via the Button on the Website that is localy hosted.

Then you steer the red dot with your PS4 Controller.
(PS4 Controller needs MAC Adress adressed to the ESP32 -> do this with SixAxisPairTool)

Hold R2 for sprint Mode -> double the speed.

Simple task is to evade the spawning blocks for as long as possible.

Highscore is safed on local Website. (no database)
